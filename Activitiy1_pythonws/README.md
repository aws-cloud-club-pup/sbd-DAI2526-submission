# Instructions

## 1. Access the material

You can access the material in your [Skill Builder Department Learning Management System (SBD LMS)](https://sbd.awsccpup.cloud) 

## 2. Create a Copy

We only set the notebook into a **Read-Only**. To complete the activity you must create your own copy.

- Open the link.
    
- On the top menu, go to `File > Save a copy in Drive`.
    
- A new tab will open with your personal copy. Work on this new tab.

## 3. Complete the tasks
- **Solve the Challenges:** Use slicing techniques (e.g., `list[start:stop:step]`) to extract the required elements.

- **Mind Your Style:** Ensure your variable names and spacing follow **PEP 8 guidelines** as discussed in the workshop.

- **Run All Cells:** Verify that your output matches the expected results before downloading.
